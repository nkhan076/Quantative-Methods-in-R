This project applies all the statistical learning concepts introduced in the text book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". The report
is presented for a dataset named ‘Energy Efficient’. This dataset is collected from UCI website. There
are two predicting parameter in the dataset i.e. Heating and cooling load while there are 8 predictor
